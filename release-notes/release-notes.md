# Release Notes

**New Features**

A new feature has been added that allows the user to see the analysis of the attrition of developers in the Clientâ€™s software estate using a Pie-chart comparing Total BCE and number of developers.

This chart provides information corresponding to different groups namely New, New-Inactive, Long-Term Staff, and Inactive represented with green, yellow, blue, and grey colors. The second chart gives a detailed explanation of its respective group name, values of Total BCE, % of Total BCE, and the number of developers whenever a user hover-over mouse on any individual group name.

Overall, for total BCE, the new group made the least contribution, while the long term staff made the highest contribution. In comparison, for the number of developers, the New-Inactive group made the least contribution, while the long term staff made the highest contribution.
