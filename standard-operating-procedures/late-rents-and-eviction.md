### PURPOSE:

This SOP provides step-by-step instructions to be followed to evict when any Tenant fails to pay rent within the stipulated timeframe.

### OBJECTIVE:

1. Follow up with Tenants who aren't paying rent on time
2. Apply Late Charges
3. Initiate Eviction Process if still unpaid

### PROCESS OVERVIEW:

1. When any Tenant is due 10 days of paying their rent:
   1. Verify whether the rent is still paid or not
   2. Follow up and request payment
2. If still there is no response, start the eviction process.

_Note:_

* _Do not wait for more than 10 days. Initiate the Eviction process immediately. For example, if the rent is due on 1st November and the current date is 10th November, they are already due for 10 days. Hence, immediately call the attorney and start the eviction process on the 10th day itself._
* _Exception: If the Tenant has a long history with us and never paid late, try to reach them for another 2 more days using the hammer time approach. If there is still no response, then start the Eviction process._

  1. Check [ZOHO](https://crm.zoho.com/crm/org635091059/tab/CustomModule58/custom-view/2135217000196839232/list) to verify whether any rent payment is made in the last 7 days
  2. Check [YIBH](https://yesibuyhouses.com/admin/accounting/bills) and select filter “Past 7 day’s active and closed bills”

1. Once confirmed that the payment is still past due using the above, follow up using the below methods and their respective scripts in sequence based on the Tenant’s response:
   1. Call
   2. Send email
   3. Send Voice Mail

**Call Script**

_Hey XXX! This is XXX calling from the Rental office. I hope everything is okay?_

_I’m just reaching out as we haven't received your rent payment for the month of XXXX._

_Your rent amount of $ XXX plus a late fee $ XX is due immediately._

_**\*\*\*Hear them out & Acknowledge and ask the below questions\*\*\***_

* _Alright! Can you let me know when you are going to pay them? Can you provide me with an actual date of payment to be expected?_
* _And how much will you pay?_
* _What would be the payment method? (eg. bank transfer, bill.com)_

_Positive Response -> Wonderful! I’ll make a note of that and come back to you if we find any difficulties in receiving the payment. Have an amazing day ahead! Cheers, Bye!_

_Negative Response -> I understand that these things happen occasionally due to financial difficulties but I hope you understand we cannot furnish free housing without getting into financial difficulties ourselves. I suggest it is always to your benefit to pay before any legal actions are pursued as it would affect your credit history and overall credit rating._

_Because, as per the protocols, if your rent payment remains past due, we are obliged to commence the eviction proceedings immediately. I’m really hoping we don't have to go that far and make it difficult for you to find rental homes in the future as well as these will reflect on your credit history. Hope you understand the situation. Thanks, bye!_

  1. [Intake Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1SiR7Lj0frRyvBQpn_x14Ja12DtXosl8R) template

**E-MAIL TEMPLATE**

_Subject: START EVICTION REQUEST for \[Property Address]_

_Hello Atty. XXXX,_

_Good Day!_

_This is XXX from SSG Real Estate working with Avi and Maryellen._

_May we request you to start eviction for tenant Nicole Brewster - 96 Coen St (2nd flr)? (Include Name and Address of the tenant)_

_Please see attached Intake form, Lease and Ledger for your reference._

_Sincerely,_

_The Rental Office_

1. After sending an email, follow up with attorney via call immediately asking them when they can serve the Notice to Quit (NTQ). If they say tomorrow, enter the follow up date on eviction with tomorrow's date and in the Next Step Eviction, enter “Call tomorrow to confirm if NTQ was served”.

_Note: NTQ is basically an order to pay now or move out in 5 days so essentially giving Tenants a 5 day notice period._

1. Follow up again with the attorney as per the Next Step Eviction to verify if they have served NTQ. If yes, get a copy of the NTQ and upload in the Eviction module. Also, ask when does the NTQ date expires because it is the legal 1st date where we can file in the court to start the eviction in the courts.

_Note:_

* _This is a key date because until we start a court filing, we can't get a court date and we can't start a court date without a NTQ served._
* _Typically, the date from which you serve the NTQ and presuming you file the court papers the very day you are eligible you can't even get tenants out for about 2 months best case. (In PG county Maryland, it is 6 months). Hence, it is imperative that these are to be done on a timely basis._

1. In NTQ expiry date, update the NTQ date you got from attorney.
2. If they fail to pay within NTQ, start a legal proceeding to begin to vacate them.
3. On the NTQ expire date, call the attorney to confirm if they have filed with the court hammer time. If not, ask them to file.
4. Ask the attorney the next step in the legal process and get copy of filing to put in eviction next steps.
5. Get court date and Actual Court Date:
   1. Enter Estimated Court Date and Actual Court Date in eviction module and put this as next step on eviction and next step eviction follow up date.

_Note: Some jurisdictions when you file NTQ will give you a court date online, some will Connecticut give an answer date where the tenant can respond why they did not pay. While the others say that attorney will receive the court date by mail. Moreover, the attorney for property manager should typically know approximately how long it will take to get a court date._

*
  1. Get Actual court: 1 day before court you will need to update attorney with latest ledger since the Tenant may have paid some rent. Notify them that they have sent it.

1. On day of court, put in eviction steps what happened at court
   1. Execution: If the tenant did not respond because of a car accident or any other unfortunate incident, then usually we have to wait for 5-10 days to file. So, in this case, ask attorney about the next step. If attorney says we can execute file in 10 days, put that date as next follow up date and put next step as call attorney to confirm he/she has filed for the execution.
2. After execution is filed, it has to be granted by the judge, follow up with attorney if it was granted and know the next step.

_Note:_

* _Typically after it is granted, the judge in court will send the execution approval to the Sheriff's department in Maryland, DC, and Virginia. Gather Sheriff Department contact details from Attorney/Property Manager and confirm if they have received the approval and then ask them approximately when they will pull the tenants out._
* _In some counties like PG, even though the Sheriff gets the execution request they may not be able to pull the Tenant out for 3-6 months as they are a small office. So, it is critical to know approximately when they can pull them out. If they can’t get you the exact date, ask them for the approximate date to follow up. For example, if they say 2 weeks, enter that in next step, but call within 1 week for a follow up._

1. Know about several dates in advance before the date Sheriff Pulls the Tenant out because:
   1. We need to put utilities in our name
   2. We have to send someone to the house to change the locks.
   3. In some jurisdictions like PG county and Maryland, they also make us hire 25 people to move the tenants stuff to the street curb.
   4. In CT, the attorney needs to work with sheriff who hires moving company (which we have to pay for) to move their belongings to curb.

So, this date we must let everyone on our team know the date is pulling tenant out of the home and you need to know that we have someone going to house to change locks. Also, we will then need to coordinate with repairs and advertise for rent/sale or both.

In between, the Sheriff normally delivers a letter informing Tenants they are coming to vacate them so they give them a few days to move out peacefully, which is the best case if it happens we can save money and time, this is why it’s important to stay in touch with Tenant as well. Legally if Tenant is cooperative and gives us keys that is legally they are moved out.

1. When we vacate tenant whether by Sheriff or they vacate themselves and handover keys to us, update ZOHO contact regarding their actual move out date and Tenant type to Tenant moved out.
2. Inform our team, accounting and Cristina and office staff.
3. Perform tenant moved out steps:
   1. Remove/stop recurring Tenant invoice in bill.com so they stop getting invoices
   2. Mark contacts as moved out
   3. Calculate security deposit return and revert to them if they are eligible to receive any after money owed or damages or any fees within 30 days.

#### EVICTION CHECKLIST:

Daily Checklist to check each Eviction phase:

☐ Check the summary on [ZOHO Dashboard](https://crm.zoho.com/crm/org635091059/tab/Dashboards)

☐ Check if we have missed to notify any Evictions to attorney

☐ Check if any Tenant still owes money (on [Invoices – Owed](https://yesibuyhouses.com/admin/sage/invoicesowed) page) and are ignoring calls. If yes, start Eviction process right away.

☐ Check if any attorney has not sent out NTQ after you asked them to start eviction.

☐ Check if NTQ copy is received or not.

☐ If no, reach out to them and ask to send NTQ.

☐ After receiving the NTQ copy, ensure to track the progress of getting this NTQ served to Tenant.

☐ Check the NTQ expire day to see whether we are eligible to open up a court case

☐ Check to see which files the attorney has not opened up a court case (that means we did not get a court date or an estimated court date).

☐ Follow up with the attorney or property manager/agent when you can expect a court date and get copy of the filing. If they have a date, enter the court date. If they have no date, ask for an estimated court date.

☐ On day of court, check whether compliance is followed or not ensuring whether we got stipulated agreement to all pay dates we agreed to and also track its progress.
