### Objective:

The objective of this SOP is intended for “Order to Call” to build a vendor database where we can find out the best vendor for the maintenance/renovation works based on their credibility.

### Overview:

Whenever the maintenance department receives calls from the tenants for any issue to be fixed, they have to find the best vendor in terms of “pricing and quality” and send them to the tenant’s location to fix the problem. To find one, we need to have a database where we can find them quickly.

Hence, this SOP is designed to help the “Order to Call” team to build a vendor database where they gather all the necessary parameters of the vendor to decide their credibility. Credibility of the vendor is decided based on the following:

* Availability
* Number of reviews
* Ratings
* Number of years in business
* Affordable pricing
* Communicative
* Reliability
* Honesty

We consider the Average Rating of 4 and above with more reviews as “Good” and below as “Not good”.

Once we have a database, if we receive any maintenance call, we will check our vendor database and will choose the best vendor based on their credibility quickly.

#### Procedure:
