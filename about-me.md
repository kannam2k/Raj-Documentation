# About me

My name is Raj Kumar, and I have over 5 years of experience in Technical Writing. In this cover letter, I will share my experiences in tech writing, the challenges I faced and how I addressed them, and my future goals…\

My Technical Writing experience&#x20;

I began my career as a Technical Writer in 2019 at Thryve Digital LLP, where I worked for 3 years and 3 months. My main role involved creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for various healthcare-related process documents, categorized as Process Documentation.\
\
In this position, my daily routine included collaborating with my team to review our project board's backlog, prioritizing tasks as necessary, and diving into the work. Once I selected a task, I would conduct research and development before reaching out to the Subject Matter Expert (SME) to clarify the initial requirements. During the R\&D, I would jot down questions to ask the SME. In our meetings, I focused on grasping the process in detail and any additional requirements that needed documentation.

For instance, if I needed to document the process for submitting a claim request on the INSINQ application, I would outline the entire process and include screenshots to illustrate how to submit a claim request in a step-by-step format.

In addition to documentation, I was also responsible for:

•        Proofreading my peers' documents to ensure accurate process documentation.

•        Organizing and maintaining all developed documents in the SharePoint repository.

•        Auditing existing documents with their owners to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing improvement.

In October 2022, I transitioned to CGI as a Technical Writer, where I have been working for two years now.

Project 1: I served as both a Business Analyst and Technical Writer for the e-signature project. My responsibilities included gathering requirements for an e-signature platform aimed at consolidating various e-signature tools like DocuSign, CGI DT360, Scrive, and e-Mudra into one accessible location.

I held several project meetings to collect business requirements from stakeholders and created the Business Requirements Document (BRD), Business Use Cases, Operational Documents, and Support RACI. I served as a liaison between the Solution owner and the development team to ensure the implementation of all Business Use Cases.

For instance, in a Business Use Case regarding a Non-Disclosure Agreement, the requirement was to create a feature that allows the initiator to upload an NDA and add multiple users to sign the document. For this type of use case, I documented the requirements and served as a liaison between the stakeholders and the development team to ensure successful implementation.

To verify the functionalities, I crafted various test cases to ensure they met the business requirements.

In Project 2, I worked as a Technical Writer for PLM Documentation. My role involved gathering requirements from the Subject Matter Expert (SME) and collaborating with them daily to understand the target audience for the documentation, ensuring the information was presented clearly and concisely.

For example, when documenting the promotion request process for a Battery product, I would have the SME walk me through the steps involved in raising a promotion request on the Windchill application. Based on this walkthrough, I created training guides for end users.

Additionally, I produced over 20 training videos covering complex topics such as how to raise a promotion request, change request, and change notice for a product using the Adobe Captivate tool.

### Challenges at work

Process Documentation Challenges:

QC Standards:

During my initial technical writing journey, my documents only met 80% of the organizational standards because I overlooked certain guidelines regarding word usage and abbreviations. To improve this, I developed a detailed checklist of the organizational standards and established a thorough self-review process prior to submitting documents. Then, I achieved full compliance with quality control (QC) standards.\

E-Signature Project:

Requirements Gathering:

As a technical writer, I initially found it challenging to bridge the gap between technical documentation and business analysis. The first few meetings with stakeholders were especially tough, necessitating a major adjustment in how I gathered requirements.\
\
To overcome, I:

•        Developed active listening skills to understand the stakeholder viewpoints.

•        Successfully converted complex business requirements into straightforward documentation.

•        Built effective communication channels with the development team and implemented the requirements.

Platform Implementation:

After the launch, the e-signature platform faced a few operational challenges, such as:

•        Difficulties with portal sign-in

•        Problems with One-Time Password (OTP) expiration

To overcome this, I worked closely with the development team and resolved technical problems

PLM Documentation:

Documentation Format:

I originally intended to develop standard Word document training guides. However, the client asked for a more engaging presentation tailored to their Design Engineers.

Solution:

I transformed the documentation into a PowerPoint format that included:

•        Bullet-numbered instructions

•        Annotated screenshots designed according to the UX F-pattern

This approach improved user understanding by providing intuitive, visually-driven documentation. The innovative method received positive feedback.

Documenting Complex Processes:

Addressing essential PLM topics such as Promotion Requests, Change Requests, and Change Notices necessitated a different documentation strategy.

Innovative Documentation Approach:

•        Developed detailed how-to videos utilizing Adobe Captivate

•        Clarified complex workflows with clear, step-by-step visual instructions

•        Successfully conveyed intricate processes that involved multiple approvers\

My aspirations for the future

My goal is to become a skilled technical writer by learning a wide range of technical writing tools and exploring various industry sectors. At the same time, I plan to investigate artificial intelligence technologies that can simplify and improve the work efforts of technical writers.
